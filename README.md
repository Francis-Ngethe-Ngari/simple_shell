- Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix System. Gathers input from user and excutes programs based on input. When a 
program finishes executing it displays program output.# 

**Introduction to shell**

- In C Programming, `shell'` A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system.
It serves as an intermediary between the user and the operating system, providing a way to execute commands and manage
files and processes.

- How does the program work?

- The shell format refers to the structure and syntax used in a shell program or script. Depending on the operating system, there are different shell formats, each with its own set of rules and syntax.

Some commonly used shell formats are:

1. Bash (Bourne Again SHell): This is the default shell for most Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS. Bash is an expanded version of the original Bourne shell (sh) and is backward compatible with it. It supports various features like command completion, command substitution, variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and more.

2. C shell (csh): This is another popular shell used primarily in Unix-based systems. It provides a C-like syntax and supports features like aliases, command history, job control, and command-line editing.

3. Korn shell (ksh): The Korn shell is an enhanced version of the Bourne shell that incorporates features from C shell and Bash. It offers a rich set of programming capabilities, including arrays, arithmetic operations, command-line editing, and advanced scripting features.

4. PowerShell: PowerShell is a shell designed for Windows operating system. It combines the features of a command-line shell and a scripting language. PowerShell uses a syntax similar to C# and provides extensive automation and management capabilities for Windows systems.

These are just a few examples of shell formats, and there are many others available. The specific format you use will depend on the operating system and the requirements of your scripting or command-line tasks.
